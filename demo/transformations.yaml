# A transformation is how we turn the data that is in one schema to another
# Typically we transform from the task request schema to the service request schema
# then with the response we turn it from the service response schema to the task response schema


# Here we define the chain of responsibility to go looking for the right transformation
# We can use <task>, <service> and <direction> in the path. ReqOrResp is either 'service_to_task' or 'task_to_service'
